# Social Media Trend Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes social media data (Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.) to identify trending topics, user sentiments, and market shifts. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis, businesses can gain insights into audience preferences, emerging trends, and brand perception.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
✔ Analyze trending topics to understand user interests and market trends.  
✔ Perform sentiment analysis to categorize opinions as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.  
✔ Visualize insights through interactive dashboards for data-driven decision-making.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
### Python Libraries:
- **pandas, numpy**: Data Manipulation
- **TextBlob, NLTK**: Sentiment Analysis
- **matplotlib, seaborn, plotly**: Visualization
- **WordCloud, CountVectorizer**: Topic Modeling

### APIs:
- **Tweepy**: Twitter API
- **BeautifulSoup**: Web Scraping

### Dashboards:
- **Power BI, Excel**

## 📊 Approach
### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Cleaning
- Extract social media posts using Tweepy API or web scraping.
- Clean text data by removing:
  - URLs, mentions (@), hashtags (#)
  - Special characters, stopwords, and punctuation
  - Convert text to lowercase for consistency

### 2️⃣ Sentiment Analysis
- Use TextBlob to compute polarity scores for each post.
- Classify sentiment:
  - **Positive** (Polarity > 0)
  - **Negative** (Polarity < 0)
  - **Neutral** (Polarity = 0)

### 3️⃣ Topic Extraction
- Identify top 10 trending keywords using CountVectorizer.
- Assign topic labels based on frequent terms (e.g., "Tech," "Politics," "Sports").

### 4️⃣ Visualization & Insights
- 📈 **Sentiment Distribution**: Pie chart showing % of Positive/Negative/Neutral posts.
- 🔥 **Top Trending Topics**: Bar chart of most-discussed keywords.
- 📊 **Sentiment by Topic**: Stacked bar chart comparing sentiment per topic.
- ☁️ **Word Cloud**: Visual representation of frequent terms.
- ⏳ **Sentiment Over Time**: Line graph tracking sentiment trends (if date data is available).
- 🌐 **Interactive Charts**: Sunburst & Treemap for hierarchical sentiment-topic analysis.
- 🧩 **Co-occurrence Heatmap**: Shows relationships between frequently paired words.

## 🚀 Business Applications
- ✅ **Brand Monitoring**: Track public sentiment about products/services.
- ✅ **Competitor Analysis**: Compare trends with rival brands.
- ✅ **Marketing Strategy**: Optimize campaigns based on trending topics.
- ✅ **Crisis Management**: Detect negative sentiment early and respond proactively.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Real-time analysis using streaming APIs (e.g., Twitter Streaming API).
- Advanced NLP models (BERT, GPT-3) for deeper sentiment understanding.
- Competitor benchmarking by analyzing multiple brands simultaneously.
- Automated alerts for sudden sentiment shifts.
